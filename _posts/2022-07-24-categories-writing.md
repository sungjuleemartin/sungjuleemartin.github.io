## Revised Excerpt of "Impact of Immigration on the Economy: Immigrants and GDP per Capita" 
by Sungju Lee



Some individuals harbor doubts about immigration, particularly concerning whether an increase in immigration could negatively impact them. While it is true that increased immigration can positively affect the economy of the United States, as population growth typically correlates with a rise in GDP, this does not necessarily equate to improved circumstances for individuals. If the increase in GDP is directly proportional to the increase in immigration, for instance, GDP per capita remains unchanged, thereby leaving the lives of natives unaffected. Therefore, to demonstrate that immigration benefits natives, it is essential to examine its effect on the U.S. economy at the individual level. If GDP per capita increases after immigration, it at least means that the people, including the native and the immigrants, are living better on average.

However, this also implies that an increase in GDP per capita does not necessarily correlate directly to the benefit of natives. Natives are not a homogeneous group; they can be divided by various factors including race, wage level, and type of jobs. Consequently, if immigrants replace natives in certain positions, it could lead to a decrease in the welfare of natives despite the increase in GDP per capita. In such cases, conventional indicators like GDP, GDP per capita, or average household income may fail to distinguish the impact of immigrants on natives. Thus, measures demonstrating changes in the average income of natives following immigration are necessary to prove that immigrants' impact is not detrimental.

Unfortunately, such indicators are currently unavailable, and relevant data is difficult to obtain. To address this issue, additional data beyond GDP per capita, such as median income over time by race, will be utilized. By analyzing the race of immigrants and the years during which a significant number of immigrants from a particular race are added, we can assess whether a correlation exists between the median income of a specific race and immigration. For example, if immigrants predominantly occupy jobs traditionally held by white individuals, the median income of white people might experience changes, such as decreases or slowdowns. While this approach may not guarantee complete accuracy, it can help identify whether common beliefs, such as immigrants taking certain types of jobs, are reflected in the data.

Therefore, this paper incorporates tests for GDP per capita to demonstrate the significance of immigration in enhancing both the nation and the lives of natives. Additionally, it includes data on the apprehension and removal of aliens to examine their relationship with GDP per capita, aiding in understanding the effect of immigration on the population. If these tests successfully demonstrate the significance of both variables, it may be possible to determine the impact of government control on accepting immigrants and whether immigrants act as substitutes for natives.

## Theory
The Solow Growth model suggests that population growth alone is not a direct source of GDP per capita growth. This led me to investigate the impact of immigration on GDP per capita, as demonstrating the significance of immigration could signify more than mere population growth. If immigration is positively correlated with an increase in GDP per capita, it implies that immigration brings additional benefits beyond population growth. As stated by Wadhwa et al. (2007), this would demonstrate the positive externality that immigrants can bring. Moreover, the Solow Growth model indicates that technological progress is a fundamental driver of GDP per capita growth, supporting the idea that immigration can contribute to technological advancement. The research findings of Gordon et al. (2016) further support this notion. Just as Gordon et al. demonstrated the importance of immigrants in STEM occupations, a positive effect of immigrants on GDP per capita would indicate a potential link between immigration and technological growth. This analysis could also shed light on the effectiveness of the selective immigration program of the United States.

Conversely, a positive correlation between immigration and GDP per capita could suggest that immigrants serve as substitutes for natives, particularly those identified as whites. Whites are known to dominate the STEM workforce, as supported by empirical data. Although Asians follow behind, the disparity in numbers between the two groups is significant. Therefore, if the influx of immigrants leads to technological progress by displacing STEM jobs held by natives, particularly whites, it could potentially impact the median income of white individuals. This possibility was also considered in this paper.
